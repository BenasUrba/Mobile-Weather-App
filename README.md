Different weatherpage versions (light mode and dark mode) the icons and text also changes its versions/colours depending on the theme used. Some information was calculated based on my calculations and equations. For example, the precipitation probabability was calculated by getting the average of all precipitation for that day. This was necessary as the free version did not offer this information.
